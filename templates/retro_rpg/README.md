# retro RPG template

This project is meant to help you with ideas for setting up a retro RPG, like in the style of Final Fantasy 4/5, Pokemon, or Zelda. It's intent is to be extremely asset-driven, so you should be able to make a game with very little code changes (just edit your assets.)

## Features

- dialog-flows that can be easily edited in markdown (vi [mdif](https://github.com/notnullgames/mdif))
- simple mapping in [tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/)
- normalized characters (easier NPC & player modification with spritesheets) that you can edit graphically [here](https://notnullgames.github.io/universal-sprites/)

## Usage

```sh
npm i
npm start
```
